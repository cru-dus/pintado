PINTADO

NAME
	Pintado - a simple drawing application.
	
DESCRIPTION
	Draw simple objects such as points and lines using key events.
	
	Here are the different key events recognized by Pintado:
	
	Change the color of the pen:
		1 - Black
		2 - Blue
		3 - Green
		4 - Red
		5 - Brown 
		6 - Yellow
		7 - White
	
	Move the pen:
		q - Upper left
		w - Upward
		e - Upper right
		a - Left
		d - Right
		z - Lower left
		s - Downward
		c - Lower Right
	NOTE: This also colors the path with the current pen color.
		Default color is black.
	
	Other keys:
		0 - Clears the canvas and moves the pen in the center.
		f - Open a drawing file.
		p - Exit pintado.
		
MANUAL
	There are two ways to draw in Pintado. The first is through the use
	of the different key events shown above. This way will surely kill 
	time, specially when you are bored; but pixel drawing is definitely 
	fun. The other way is through Pintado Programming. In this method, 
	you will write some lines of code and save it to a text file, after-
	which you will open in the Pintado application. Pintado programming
	offers additional features such as drawing rectangles and fill tool.
	It is a geeky method, but coding, sure, is fun.

PINTADO PROGRAMMING
	Here are the commands:
		I M N			- create a new M by N image with all pixels initialized in color white.
		C				- reset the canvas; setting all pixels to white.
		L X Y C			- color pixel (X,Y) in color C.
		S X1 Y1 X2 Y2	- draw a straight line from point (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2).
		R X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C	- draw a filled rectangle of color C where (X1, Y1) is the upper left
						and (X2, Y2) is the lower right corner.
